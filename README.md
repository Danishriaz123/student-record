This was a project for Programming Fundamentals II that I did in the Fall of 2014.
It was the final project of the semester.  The project was to build a linked list from scratch
(no templates!) that represents a database of student records.
	
				1) Navigate to the terminal or equivalent.
				2) Once you are in the right directory 
				   (ls and cd!)
				3) type the following: g++ Student_Record.h Student_Record.cpp Student_Main.cpp
				4) type: ./a.out

				Username: anything that is only letters
				Password: hr_acc_2014 (Hardcoded but doesn't have to be)

All new students have a randomly generated 5 digit ID number.

There is a sample record populated with some students included,
but you can add more students with the following data:

Name	Phone	Email	Major	Part-time/Full-time

You can also edit any field for any student and remove 1 or
all students at will.  

The whole list can be displayed from the menu, and when 
the program is exited the updated list is copied to the
included text file, (Or created if not present).

Looking back on this, I can definitely see quite a few things that could be done better.
